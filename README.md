# simon-say-game
The Simon Say game is a JavaScript project that replicates the classic memory game where a player must repeat an increasingly complex sequence of colors. The game uses JavaScript objects, arrays, event listeners, and functions to manage game states, generate sequences, and handle user interactions.
